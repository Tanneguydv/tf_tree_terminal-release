      TF-TREE CLI DEBUGGER
```

A lightweight ROS 2 utility for auditing, visualizing, and validating your Coordinate Transform (TF) tree. This tool tries to go beyond simple visualization by providing deep-source auditing and standard compliance checking (REP 105/199).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Deep Source Auditing**: Tracks exactly which nodes are publishing to `/tf` and `/joint_states` for every link.
* **Live vs. Static Analysis**: Automatically distinguishes between truly `STATIC` latched transforms and `LIVE` high-frequency streams.
* **Diagnostic Profiles**: Built-in validation for specific robot types:
* **Mobile**: Validates the `map` → `odom` → `base_link` chain.
* **Arm**: Validates articulated chains from `base_link` to `tool0`.


* **Precision Latency**: Reports the "age" of transforms in milliseconds to detect jitter or stale data.
* **Disjointed Tree Alerts**: Visually flags if your tree is broken into multiple disconnected components.

## 🛠 Usage

Once built and sourced, you can use the `tf-tree` command:

### Command Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--profile` | `-p` | Diagnostic mode: `mobile`, `arm`, or `auto` (default). |
| `--save` | `-s` | Export the analysis to a file (e.g., `-s robot_report.txt`). |
| `--alive` | `-a` | Keep node alive; refreshes terminal every 5 seconds. |
| `--light` | `-l` | Get a light TF-Tree as output |
| `--clear` | `-c` | Clear terminal screen before each refresh in alive mode |
| `--no-color` | `-nc` | Disable ANSI colors in output |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message and exit. |

### Examples

**Standard One-Shot Audit:**

```bash
tf-tree
```

**Save a mobile robot diagnostic to a file:**

```bash
tf-tree -p mobile -s my_robot.txt
```

**Live monitoring during a mission:**

```bash
tf-tree --alive
```

#### Example outputs

running ```tf-tree -p mobile```

```bash

## 📊 Understanding the Output

* **`⚯ Link`**: The TF frame name with its frequency (Hz).
* **`[LIVE: 15ms]`**: Data is current.
* **`[STALE: 2.1s]`**: The broadcaster has likely stopped or crashed.
* **`⚙ Joint`**: Lists the publisher nodes for both the transform and the joint state.
* **`✔ Recommendation`**: Compliance status based on the selected profile.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone to your workspace:**
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Tanneguydv/tf_tree_terminal.git
```


2. **Build:**
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select tf_tree_terminal
source install/setup.bash
```

## 💡 How it works

The debugger utilizes a `MultiThreadedExecutor` to simultaneously listen to the TF buffer while calculating statistics. It performs a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to reconstruct the tree from the YAML data provided by the ROS 2 buffer, enriching each node with metadata gathered from the graph introspection API.
